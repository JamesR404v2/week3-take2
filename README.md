# cc_training_wheels_eclipse_java

For when the starter templates aren't basic enough

A template training wheels starter for instantiating a plain java project, with Eclipse metadata

Because this is a training wheels project, please use https://github.com/petecarapetyan/cc_starter_java_eclipse as soon as you are ready, preferably right now. It won't be that much harder - no really.

## If You Can't See Green 'Use this template' Button

If instead you see the green 'Code' button then you are not signed in to github.

## How to Consume Template

- Create your project on github, not your local drive, by clicking the green template button
- Clone this down to your local drive in the appropriate workspace directory
- Import this project as an existing Eclipse project
- Start your coding in App.java's execute() method

ALWAYS rename your project from `FIXME`, after importing! See troubleshooting below!!!!! (Right click, "Refactor" then "Rename")
ALWAYS search your project for the string literal `FIXME`, and fix any as appropriate.

## How to run app

In Eclipse run App.java as a java app as you would any other app

## Troubleshooting

- A second project from this template will NOT import into a workspace if you didn't refactor the name of a previous. Hint: Look for a project in your workspace starting with the name `FIXME` and then rename that project.
- If your Eclipse is not set up with Java 11, you may expect problems that require you to add a Java 11 JDK in order to resolve. PS you need to do this anyway - your code reviewer expects that regardless of what you use as your project starter.
